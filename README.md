# yolo_grape_clusters_detection

Over the past decade, with the advent of convolutional neural networks, research and applications in the field of computer vision has become widespread. Computer vision
can be used in the automated monitoring and management in the agriculture industry. Object detection is one of the most important and popular computer vision tasks. In this work,
detection of grape clusters is performed which can be useful in monitoring of vineyards, yield estimation and automated harvesting. CNN based deep learning architecture of YOLO, is used to perform the Grape Cluster detection and compare the results obtained.
